    latest project: An application that uses graph theory to pair up Intern doctors which would
like to swap locations with each other. The app successfully helped a number doctors move to locations
closer to friends and family in the 2023 allocation round. I would like to expand on this app so that
it can be applied to all health care professions in South Africa that have a compulsory community
service year. See the app here: https://docswap.streamlit.app/
