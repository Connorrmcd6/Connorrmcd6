    latest_project: An application that uses graph theory to pair up Intern doctors which would
like to swap locations with each other. The app successfully helped a number doctors move to locations
closer to friends and family in the 2023 allocation round. The business logic of the app
is built in Python, I am looking to rebuild in Go to make it more efficient.
